  * I figured out that Aframe uses some sort of VR experience
  * You can basically make games on like Aframe since you can make scenes with different shapes
* I later started to install the Aframe script on the [introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) where there is the script for Aframe
