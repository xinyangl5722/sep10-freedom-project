Tool: **Aframe**

---

2/26/2024:
* I decided to first check out [the official website](https://aframe.io/)
  * I figured out that Aframe uses some sort of VR experience
  * You can basically make games on like Aframe since you can make scenes with different shapes
* I later started to install the Aframe script on the [introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) where there is the script for Aframe
* Next steps= Learn components on Aframe

3/3/2024:
* I started learning components on Aframe
  * I started by creating a cylinder
    ```html
    <a-cylinder position="0 1.25 -5" height="6" radius="0.5" rotation="90 45 90" color="#4CC3D9"></a-cylinder>
    ```
  *  I learned that the position always come first, then height, then radius, then rotaiton if necessary, and then color
