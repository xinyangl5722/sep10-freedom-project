## Brainstorming Future Invantions
Now I am thinking of new ideas for future inventions for my topic (art and animation). I have thought of a hardware and software inventions for art and animation.  
For the first future prototype, I decided to make an app that includes both drawing and animation. However, the two of the connects. In the animation section, you can use frames or tweening which is to create smooth animations between two keyframes. You can draw your own animation, or you can insert a drawing from your art section and also separate your drawing into different layers. You can do both frames and tweening in one animation. Then there's an art section which has a variety of brushes, colors, filters, and other tools. In addition, you can use code to animate and it's in a separate option.  
The next future invention is a stylus that has a variety of colors and brushes. You can connect it to any device you want and the pen also includes many different brushes for doodling. It has a visual and the name of the brush. You can even use the stylus like a normal stylus like moving the screen, scrolling, tapping on an app, etc. It has a grip hold and it has a long lasting battery life and can tell you what battery percentage the stylus is on. 

## Finalizing the Content
After planning the future prototype, I combined all my ideas and researchings into a google doc. First, I make an overview and introduce art and animation and how technology affects it in bullet points. Then, I copy and pasted my researchings for softwares and hardwares I've found into the google doc in bullet points. After that, I pasted all my planned future inventions in bullet points on the doc.

## EDP
Currently, I am on the **planning the solution** part of this _Engineering Design Process_. I have planned two future possible inventions inside my head and on paper. For example, I have thought of the stylus with a variety of brushes and colors and other features for the brush. In addition, I also planned a whole app that combines drawing and animation and connect them together while creating more advanced effects and tools. I am currently finished with planning my future inventions and I'm ready to take the next steps.

## Skills
One skill I have enhanced is organization. I have organized all of my content and researchings into one goodle doc and organizing them by using bullet points, sections, and modifying my words in order for them to give a clear sense for myself.  
Another skill I have learned is creativity. I learned how to create and think outside the box to create not one, but two new prototypes. I was able to create a prototype using inspiration and what I would want in an art and aninmation software and hardware and using these to create my own future prototype. I also got some inspiration from previous [freedom project websites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nb-VeVd8WpX3cT0z6-XFLsbRGXGfZmOglPl-whd3ZpM/edit#gid=0) as inspiration.

## Summary
Overall, I am very excited to combine all my researchings and ideas into creating one whole website for my project.
