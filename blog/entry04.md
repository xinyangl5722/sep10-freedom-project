## Findind a Tool
Lately, I have been finding tools for my freedom project to build a website in. First, I looked at [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) and tinkered with it. I followed the CDN. In the head, I typed up this code.
```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
Once I typed up that code in the head, I started to copy and paste another code and typed up the CSS.
```
  <style type="text/tailwindcss">
    @layer utilities {
      .content-auto {
        content-visibility: auto;
      }
    }
  </style>
  ```
  I later started to add an `h1` in the body, and went over to the CSS and typed the code.
  ```
  h1 {
    background-color: green;
  }
  ```
  I started tinkering more examples, which is how I decided to choose Tailwind as one of my tools.
