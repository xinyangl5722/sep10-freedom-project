# Entry 1: Art and Animation
##### 10/23/2023

## Choosing a topic  
The topic I chose was art and animation. I have been passionate in this subject since I was in my pre-teen years. I loved the different art styles I've seen from other people and the details in certain animations. I had made different universes and would love to make them an animated series or comic books one day. Plus, I have seen many different characters with their own unique style and personality. There was an anime I recently discovered and the animation was very detailed. When I saw the manga, the characters looked very detailed and majestic as well. I want to see what kind of technology they used to get those detailed art and animations.  
  
One of the sources I have found was [How Technology Evolutions changed Animation](https://apilama.com/2020/06/29/how-technology-evolutions-changed-animation/). This link helps me understand how animations have gotten higher quality and how technology changed the style of animation. Another link I had found was [How Technology is Changting the Art World](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.). This link shows how art has evolved in many different ways. I have also found a link that shows [The best digital art software](https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/the-best-software-for-digital-artists) This gives me an understanding of how art has improved by using these softwares in this website. I also used my own knowledge and the apps I have downloaded since I'm an artist myself. This helped me give an understanding on how artists make their own art and how they processed their art and animation.  

## EDP
I am currently at the first and second stage, which is defining the main problem, and researching the problem. The main problem I have observed is **how technology in animation and art isn't really mentioned much**. The second step, which is researching gives me more information about how technology has formed art and animation. For instance, art and animation had become digital and new innovations and softweares were invented such as drawing tablets, digital pen, and drawing apps like ibis paint x, Adobe anime, etc. I may need to do more research before I move on the third step which is to brainstorm possible solutions.
