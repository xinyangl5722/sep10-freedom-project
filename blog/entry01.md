# Entry 1: Art and Animation
##### 10/23/2023

## Choosing a topic  
The topic I chose was art and animation. I have been passionate in this subject since I was in my pre-teen years. I loved the different art styles I've seen from other people and the details in certain animations. I had made different universes and would love to make them an animated series or comic books one day. Plus, I have seen many different characters with their own unique style and personality. There was an anime I recently discovered and the animation was very detailed. When I saw the manga, the characters looked very detailed and majestic as well. I want to see what kind of technology they used to get those detailed art and animations.  
  
One of the sources I have found was [How Technology Evolutions changed Animation](https://apilama.com/2020/06/29/how-technology-evolutions-changed-animation/). This link helps me understand how animations have gotten higher quality and how technology changed the style of animation. Another link I had found was [How Technology is Changting the Art World](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.). This link shows how art has evolved in many different ways. I have also found a link that shows [The best digital art software](https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/the-best-software-for-digital-artists) This gives me an understanding of how art has improved by using these softwares in this website. I also used my own knowledge and the apps I have downloaded since I'm an artist myself. This helped me give an understanding on how artists make their own art and how they processed their art and animation.
