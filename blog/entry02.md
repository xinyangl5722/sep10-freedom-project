## Research Findings
So far, I have found a lot of information of softwares and hardwares about my topic after doing a lot of research on the internet.  
First, I tried to find softwares about art and animation. A link I found was [9 Of The Best Android Apps For Drawing And Animation In 2023](https://www.slashgear.com/1336905/best-android-apps-drawing-animation-2023/). One software I have found was called "Flipaclip". I learned that it was good for beginners and amateur animators. You can create animated videos and even gifs. There are brushes you can use from to create your animations and a variety of colors to choose from. You can even add audios that are extracted or you can record your own voice. Another website I found was [47 Best Drawing Apps and Art Apps in 2023](https://www.pixpa.com/blog/drawing-apps). One app I found was "Ibis Paint x". I was familiar with this app because I had this app myself so I can provide a lot of information for this. I had learned that it was deemed the best for androids and you can see other people's art. However from my own knowledge, there are varieties of brushes to choose from. It has more brushes than flipaclip. There are so many different editing options. You can add a filter, copy and paste a layer, control opacity levels, and even having reference templates. They also have an animation feature where you can animate as well.  
I had also found some hardware. A website I found was [4 Tools Every Animator Should Own](https://businessofanimation.com/4-tools-every-animator-should-own/). There are many different hardwares for artists and animators. One thing I found was a graphics tablet. You technically draw on it and it will transfer to your computer. Some tablets will have screens so you can see what you are drawing. Another hardware I found was the stylus pen. It can give you more control and accuracy and some even have bluetooth connectivity.

## EDP
I am currently finished with the second stage of the Engineering Design Process which is researching the problem. I have researched about different softwares and hardwares of art and animation. For instance I found out about apps for animation and drawing, such as ibis paint x that has many features for digital art as well as having an animation feature, and I also found out some hardware for art and animation such as a drawing tablet and a stylus pen which can give you an easier time drawing without using your index finger. I am currently finished with my research and ready to combine my research to one whole.

## Skills
One skill I have learned was how to read. Now when I encountered a website, I'm not going to read the whole thing. I'm only going to skim parts of the article and only read the information I'm looking for. For example, when I'm looking at the article, [4 Tools Every Animator Should Own](https://businessofanimation.com/4-tools-every-animator-should-own/), I'm not going to look at the exact product brand from this website about art and animation hardware. Instead, I'm only looking for what general hardware it is and the benefits.  
Another skill I have learned was organization. When I write down my notes for my research, I write down the website I have found in my first bullet point. Then, I indent my second bullet points and write the information about that website and unindent for the bullet point for the second website and repeat. This way, I can have little sections of different topics and my notes will be easier to read.

## Summary
Overall, I am ready to combine my research of art and animation to make paragraphs and information for my upcoming website.
