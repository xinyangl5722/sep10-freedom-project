## Research Findings
So far, I have found a lot of information of softwares and hardwares about my topic after doing a lot of research on the internet.  
First, I tried to find softwares about art and animation. A link I found was [9 Of The Best Android Apps For Drawing And Animation In 2023](https://www.slashgear.com/1336905/best-android-apps-drawing-animation-2023/). One software I have found was called "Flipaclip". I learned that it was good for beginners and amateur animators. You can create animated videos and even gifs. There are brushes you can use from to create your animations and a variety of colors to choose from. You can even add audios that are extracted or you can record your own voice. Another website I found was [47 Best Drawing Apps and Art Apps in 2023](https://www.pixpa.com/blog/drawing-apps). One app I found was "Ibis Paint x". I was familiar with this app because I had this app myself so I can provide a lot of information for this. I had learned that it was deemed the best for androids and you can see other people's art. However from my own knowledge, there are varieties of brushes to choose from. It has more brushes than flipaclip. There are so many different editing options. You can add a filter, copy and paste a layer, control opacity levels, and even having reference templates. They also have an animation feature where you can animate as well.  
I had also found some hardware. A website I found was [4 Tools Every Animator Should Own](https://businessofanimation.com/4-tools-every-animator-should-own/). There are many different hardwares for artists and animators. One thing I found was a graphics tablet. You draw your drawing with your hand on it and it will transfer to your computer. Some tablets will have screens so you can see what you are drawing. Another hardware I found was the stylus pen. It can give you more control and accuracy and some even have bluetooth connectivity.
