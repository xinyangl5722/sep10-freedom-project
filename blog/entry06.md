## Making My Website
I later started making my Freedom Project Website with planning. I first started my wireframe on both mobile and desktop version. It would be on my [planning page](https://github.com/xinyangl5722/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/plan.md). I later started to plan my website on colors and timeline.  
I started on my navbar on bootstrap. I created the navbar and changed the links and background color. Later, I started on the title. I decided to make an image as my background, so I searched up a light blue pixel art background and put it as my background. Later, I started with the context and then past innovations. I used the grid systems (containers, rows, and columns) for my past innovations. After that, I started to make my future innovation section. I had a few problems with this but I got the hang of it later on. I also used my tool which is Aframe, to create my prototype and put it on my website. After that, I changed the colors, add pictures, and figure out the spacing and borders. [This is the link to my website.](https://xinyangl5722.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)

## EDP
I'm currently at the create my prototype, and testing and evaluating the prototype as I was making my website and looking at the preview at the same time. I am currently finished with my mvp and done with the website and I have been looking at my preview multiple times to see if my code works. Sometimes it didn't and I had to figure it out.  

## Skills
One of the skills I have learned was debugging. I had seen multiple errors on my website, such as when I had to change my navbar to a different color. It didn't work. My code was something like this. 
```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
```
I later found out that I had to delete the `bg-body-tertiary`. So I deleted that and I got this.
```html
<nav class="navbar fixed-top navbar-expand-lg" style="background-color:#CDF5FD;">
```
And then my navbar changed into a different color that I wanted.  
Another skill that I had learned was problem decomposition as I break my website into itty bitty pieces. Each day, I started on each component one by one each day. For example, I started the navbar first, and then my context, then innovations, etc. Once I finished everything, I started doing my CSS and changing the background, and color, and I did the same thing. I made my way down with the CSS. Finally, I did my Aframe last and then I finished my website.

## Summary
Overall, I am finished with my MVP and I am ready to go beyond MVP.
