## Presenting My Website
First off, I presented my website in class. I created my slides for the project [which is right here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cfgeX5PuMDlMStDAAmx4N3Nbm3sYAA457B3NO6VqR1o/edit#slide=id.p). I had created a light blue theme and used bullet points with simplified texts to make things more clear in my project. I had also included a link to my website as well along with my process. Plus, I presented these slides to the whole class and talked about my website, and the process of making them.  
These are pretty much my takeways
* Simplify things in the slides= Don't use paragraphs by paragraphs and let the text take up the entire space. Nobody is going to read that. Put bullet points and short and specific sentences to make things more clear.
* Speak clearly= People will not understand you if you speak quietly and just mumbling words. Talking loud and speaking clearly will allow the audience to understand what they are being presented by.
* Fake confidence= Give a more of a happy energy and make your tone sound confident like speaking loud and giving some sort of emotion of excitement so people will know you are sharing good information. Even if your information sucks, you can make the audience seem that it is actually good information.
